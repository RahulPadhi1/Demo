Of my ideas, I successfully added the coin boost and cactus drawback. At first, I tried to make the coin a different powerup, but the 
Sprite was not loading and the feature was not working. After a lot of time spent on it, I realized I could just make the coin a powerup
making the coin work and function more effectively. Since the game became very easy, I made the cacti, which were doing nothing, push the 
character downwards on the screen. This way, it eliminates options the player can go to while funcitoning differently than the mob. Finally, 
I decided to make an endscreen since it felt awkward to just restart the game. I also added sound effects for all three additions and added
pause when you hit the mob since I was confused how I hit the mob alot of the time. Some bugs my additions have is that the cactus 
does not boost you downwards when you are on equal level with it and the end screen does not load sometimes when you die to the mob. 

If I had more time, I would try to make this a 2 player game. At first, my goal was to make the game a two player game, but I was getting 
too stuck on this and decided to come back to it if I had the time.
